# Advent of Code solutions
My solutions to advent of code problems.

- [2023](2023)
- [2024](2024)

2023 solutions have 2 separate binaries, runnable by `cargo run --bin part-1` or `cargo run --bin part-2`.
For 2024 solutions, the parts are not separated like this, and both parts are run with one `cargo run` -command.

Most of my solutions include tests, that have the example inputs to make sure the solutions work properly.
The tests can be run with `cargo test`.
